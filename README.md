# EggWriter

eggwriter is a Python library that empowers you to programmatically control a robot drawing toy — freeing it from its original limitations.

## Why I created this
The example robot I use is called WEDRAW, a [SCARA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCARA) type robot with two arms to hold a pen and draw on paper. 
Many other venders have similar products. They scan cards to draw preprogrammed designs. Although there are hundreds of card selections (to be purchased),
the toy doesn't draw arbitrary things - not extensible - until now!

This library has code to generate input files that the toy accepts, so that it draws user-defined images.

## Demo
This youtube [video](https://tinyurl.com/eggwriter) shows the robot drawing 'LOVE'. 
The card is used to trigger start drawing. The original content from the card has been replaced.
